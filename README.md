# Mini NATS (Still in development)

Mini NATS is a lightweight implementation of the NATS messaging system in Rust. It provides a simple yet efficient way to create publish-subscribe messaging patterns in your applications.

## Features

- **Publish-Subscribe Model**: Mini NATS follows the publish-subscribe messaging pattern, allowing publishers to send messages to specific subjects, and subscribers to receive messages based on their subscriptions.

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Mini NATS is built with asynchronous I/O, making it suitable for high-performance and concurrent applications.

- **Wildcard Subscriptions**: Subscribers can use wildcard subscriptions to listen to multiple subjects with a single subscription.

<!-- ## Usage

To use Mini NATS in your Rust project, simply add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
mini_nats = "0.1.0"
``` -->
